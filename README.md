# Blackjack
This is literally just blackjack. I made it entirely while I was bored at school using my [online game template](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck/Simple-Online-Game-Template) (which you can use too).

# Open Source
I made the game open source in case anyone wants to learn about the basics of developing online games or in case other people want to make their own versions and edits to the game. I don't care what you do with my code as long as you make sure to follow the MIT license.
